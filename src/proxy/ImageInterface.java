package proxy;
//You are working on an application that needs to load a large number of images from a remote server.
// The remote server has limited bandwidth and the images are large, so it takes a long time to download them.
// In order to improve the performance of the application, you decide to implement a Proxy that caches images
// that have already been downloaded.
//To implement the Proxy, you will need to:
// Create an Image interface
//Create a RealImage class
// Create a CachedImage class
public class ImageInterface {
   // void upload();
}
